oculus
======

A Max/MSP/Jitter object to provide access to the Oculus Rift HMD via the LibOVR SDK.

This is the development branch. Please check out the "oculus_package" branch into your Documents/Max 7/Packages folder, ```cd``` into the ```source``` folder, and ```git submodule update```. 

## Development setup

The project is intended to be placed with the following structure. Relative paths may need to be changed if this is not the case.

```
(My) Documents/Max 7/
	MaxSDK-6.1.4/
	Packages/
		oculus_package/
			source/
```

That is, if you have checked out the oculus_package branch into Documents/Max 7/Packages, then there should be a copy of the Max SDK unzipped to the Documents/Max 7/ folder.
