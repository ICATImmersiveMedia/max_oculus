oculus
======

A Max/MSP/Jitter object to provide access to the Oculus Rift HMD via the LibOVR SDK. 

Currently supports DK1 and DK2 (though you'll want to rotate the meshes with @rotatexyz 0 0 90 for DK2). 

The object reports head orientation as well as the HMD calibration parameters, and the maxhelp patch demonstrates rendering pipeline for the appropriate distortion.
