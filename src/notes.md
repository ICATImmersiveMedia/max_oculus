# Direct to Rift notes

## Setup 

Configure rendering with ovrHmd_ConfigureRendering() 

May need HWND window and HDC device context â€” not clear whether optional. 

Windows users will need to call ovrHmd_AttachToWindow() to direct its swap-chain output to the HMD. Needs HWND window.

Configure textures in ovrGLTexture (just needs textureID)

## Rendering

See p33 of guide.

All on render thread. Can either use one texture per eye, or same texture with half viewport.

ovrFrameTiming <- ovrHmd_BeginFrame()
ovrHmd_GetHmdPosePerEye()
<draw 1st eye world into render texture>
ovrHmd_GetHmdPosePerEye()
<draw 2nd eye world into render texture>
ovrHmd_EndFrame() // distortion render, buffer swap, gpu sync

In Max this can be triggered in the [t b b erase] kind of setup perhaps. Need to find out what hooks can be made into jit.gl.node in case that would make it better? 

@see http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/rift.html:
If the HMD is in direct mode you can use either a full screen or a windowed mode window, but full screen is only recommended if there is a monitor that supports the resolution of the HMD. Due to limitations in LibOVR, the size of the client area of the window must equal the resolution of the HMD. If the resolution of the HMD is much larger than the regular monitor, the window may be resized by the window manager on creation. One way to avoid this is to make it undecorated with the GLFW_DECORATED window hint.

Looks like I need to create a window, even in direct mode.
